# WindowManager

*WindowManager* is a container for [WindowView](../windowView/windowView.md) objects (windows). *WindowManager* is responsible for positioning windows and controlling windows' z-index depending on window focus. Uses [layout](../layout/layout.md) to dock windows and arrange their location. *Layout* object is injected into the *WindowManager* thus it is not stuck to a certain layout.

When window is added to a *WindowManager*, the *WindowManager* will try to dock it by inserting it into its layout. If *WindowManager* failed to dock the window then window remains undocked (floating).

## API reference

Extends the [L.Evented](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.0.html#evented) class therefore it provides convenient subscription methods like *on(...)* and *off(...)*.

#### Usage example

```javascript
    var layout = new PerimeterLayout(...);

    var windowManager = new WindowManager({
        element: document.querySelector('#windows-area'),
        layout: layout
    });

    var graphViewWindow = new CategoryGraphView(...);

    // graphViewWindow is added to the manager and is shown docked inside #windows-area element.
    windowManager.addWindow(graphViewWindow);
    // undock graphViewWindow and make it floating. graphViewWindow will restore its default geometry.
    windowManager.undockWindow(graphViewWindow);
    // dock graphViewWindow.
    windowManager.dockWindow(graphViewWindow);
    // remove graphViewWindow from the manager. This will cause window to destroy and disappear.
    windowManager.removeWindow(graphViewWindow);
```
